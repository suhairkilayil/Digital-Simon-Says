# Digital-sImon-Says
ðŸš€ Built a Digital Simon Says Game in Verilog using behavioral modeling on Vivado. Itâ€™s a 2-player reaction game using a pseudo-random LFSR for direction, real-time scoring, and winner detection logic. Fully simulated using a testbench with random player input â€” ready for FPGA integration.
